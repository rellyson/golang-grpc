## Introduction

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is an open source remote procedure call system, initially developed at Google in 2015. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems.

In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services.
